Jessica Pietsch: Information Management & Digital Engagement Professional
Connecting People, Ideas, and Data for Social Impact

I am a seasoned communications and engagement professional, and an accredited archivist, librarian, and recordkeeper. My diverse career has spanned subsea engineering, international development, information management, libraries and archives, and various levels of government, including recent work in space, surveying, spatial, and state government. I am driven by a passion for innovation through diversity and inclusion, advocating for human rights via open data and knowledge movements.

My work focuses on digital preservation and making personal data, records, and memory more navigable, especially for neurodivergent individuals and where traditional record-keeping systems fall short. I excel at transforming connections between people, places, and data into strategic improvements that bolster organisational success.
