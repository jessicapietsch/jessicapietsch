The “Wall of Awful” is one of the most resonant metaphors circulating in ADHD discourse — popularized and expanded through Jessica McCabe’s *How to ADHD* community. Although the original concept was developed by Brendan Mahan, McCabe’s adaptation and framing helped make it widely understood and emotionally accessible to ADHD audiences.

## The “Wall of Awful” Concept

Every unfinished task, forgotten promise, or perceived failure builds a **brick** in an internal wall — a structure of **shame, frustration, fear, and guilt** surrounding that task or similar ones.
For people with ADHD, this means that **each time we face a familiar challenge**, we’re not only confronting the *task itself*, but also the accumulated emotional debris of past failed attempts.

The wall can grow so high that even *thinking* about starting evokes anxiety, avoidance, or paralysis. This is not laziness or lack of willpower — it’s an emotional-cognitive response to repeated negative feedback loops.

McCabe often reframes this as part of her broader theme of **“working with your brain, not against it.”** In her work, she helps audiences name the emotional friction, validate its weight, and develop compassionate, low-pressure ways to approach the wall.

## Recognizing “Bad Brain Days”

Within McCabe’s language, *bad brain days* are periods where the wall feels heavier or closer than usual.
These are not failures — they are signals.
When the wall looms large, the goal shifts from scaling it perfectly to **finding smaller footholds**: micro-tasks, rest, or re-engagement through support and structure.

## Using the Metaphor in Practice

* **Name the wall** — Identify when hesitation is emotional, not logical.
* **Reduce the load** — Break tasks down until the emotional charge drops.
* **Seek scaffolds** — Externalize memory and executive function using tools, reminders, accountability partners.
* **Practice compassion** — You don’t dismantle the wall with shame; you soften it with understanding.
* **Celebrate small crossings** — Each step over or around a brick reduces the height next time.

## Reflection

This metaphor is deeply archival in the ADHD community because it allows us to **hold the emotional reality of executive dysfunction** without collapsing into self-blame.
In McCabe’s framing, the wall becomes both obstacle and teacher — a visual map of resilience, emotion, and self-forgiveness.
