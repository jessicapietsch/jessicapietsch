PMDD for me feels like a sudden drop into another version of myself. It’s not sadness for a reason — it’s a chemical hijacking. My brain stops processing normally; thoughts loop, small things feel enormous, and emotional regulation breaks down. Everything that usually works — routines, coping skills, ADHD strategies — starts slipping through my fingers.

It’s as if the signal between “what I know” and “what I feel” cuts out. I can see myself reacting, but can’t stop it. My body feels heavy, my skin sensitive, my sleep chaotic. I become hyper-aware of rejection, noise, and clutter. Decision-making stalls; words feel harder to find.

Then, as hormones shift again, it lifts — like fog burning off — and I can’t believe how bad it got. The contrast makes it real. It’s cyclical, predictable in hindsight but chaotic in the moment.
